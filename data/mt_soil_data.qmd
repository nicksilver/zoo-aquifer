  <title>Valu1 - Montana</title>
  <abstract>The valu1 table within this 202310 database is a compilation of 57 pre-summarized or "ready to map" attributes derived from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database, including: soil organic carbon (SOC), available water storage (AWS), crop productivity indices (NCCPI), crop root zone depths, available water storage within crop root zone depths, drought-vulnerable soil landscapes, and potential wetland soil landscapes. These attribute data are pre-summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.

The 202310 Value Added Look Up (valu) Table is designed to facilitate thematic mapping for several important soil properties and interpretations. This table can be used in conjunction with any gSSURGO product of the same vintage. The themes were prepared to better meet the mapping needs of users of soil survey information and can be used with both SSURGO and gSSURGO datasets. The valu1 table contains data only for survey areas included in this gSSURGO database. Prior to FY2017, each value table was national in extent.</abstract>
