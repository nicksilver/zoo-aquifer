  abstract = {Remote sensing is a useful tool for observing the water cycle. However, combining remote sensing products over any major river basin will result in a residual error in the overall water balance. Previous studies have either quantified this error without correcting it, or have merged observations together with land surface models (LSMs) to produce a single ``best'' estimate of the water balance. Here, we present a new approach in which combinations of remote sensing and in situ observations are constrained to enforce water balance closure. Rather than a single estimate, this produces an ensemble of unique water balance estimates intended to characterize uncertainty and to avoid biases implicit in LSMs. We evaluate three techniques of varying complexity to enforce water balance closure for individual ensemble members over 24 global basins from Oct. 2002 - Dec. 2014, resulting in as many as 60 realizations of the monthly water budget, contingent upon data availability. Compared with a published climate data record, the ensemble shows strong agreement for precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in storage (R2: 0.91{\textendash}0.95), with less agreement for streamflow (R2: 0.42{\textendash}0.47), which may be indicative of LSM biases in the climate data record. Water balance residual errors resulting from combinations of raw products vary significantly (p~{$<~$}0.001) with latitude, with a tendency for positive biases for low- and mid-latitude basins, and negative biases elsewhere. Overall, residual errors are equivalent to 15\% of total precipitation when averaged across all data products and basins. This study shows that closure constraints provide additional value outside of closing the water budget, including reduction of uncertainty and transfer of closure constraints in time to provide skillful estimates of mean annual basin discharge. We also showed that a simpler closure technique, proportional redistribution, performed better than more complex ones in decreasing uncertainty and for transfer through time to estimate basin discharge when a rigorous analysis of errors for each data product is not accounted for. This observation-based dataset is distinct from modeled estimates and therefore has the potential to preserve important information of anthropogenic effects on the water balance.},

  abstract = {California's Central Valley, one of the most agriculturally productive regions, is also one of the most stressed aquifers in the world due to anthropogenic groundwater over-extraction primarily for irrigation. Groundwater depletion is further exacerbated by climate-driven droughts. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravimetry has demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying global groundwater storage changes at uniform monthly sampling, though at a coarse resolution and is thus impractical for effective water resources management. Here, we employ the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to establish empirical relationships between GRACE-derived groundwater storage and in situ groundwater level variations over the Central Valley during 2002{\textendash}2016 and achieved spatial downscaling of GRACE-observed groundwater storage changes from a few hundred km to 5 km. Validations of our modeled groundwater level with in situ groundwater level indicate excellent Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficients ranging from 0.94 to 0.97. In addition, the secular components of modeled groundwater show good agreements with those of vertical displacements observed by GPS, and CryoSat-2 radar altimetry measurements and is perfectly consistent with findings from previous studies. Our estimated groundwater loss is about 30 km3 from 2002 to 2016, which also agrees well with previous studies in Central Valley. We find the maximum groundwater storage loss rates of -5.7 {$\pm$} 1.2 km3 yr-1 and -9.8 {$\pm$} 1.7 km3 yr-1 occurred during the extended drought periods of January 2007{\textendash}December 2009, and October 2011{\textendash}September 2015, respectively while Central Valley also experienced groundwater recharges during prolonged flood episodes. The 5-km resolution Central Valley-wide groundwater storage trends reveal that groundwater depletion occurs mostly in southern San Joaquin Valley collocated with severe land subsidence due to aquifer compaction from excessive groundwater over withdrawal.},

The system couples the atmosphere and land, with moist forest that depends on convection to sustain gross primary productivity and growth. Earth system models that estimate future climate and vegetation show little agreement in Amazon simulations. Here we show that biases in internally generated climate, primarily precipitation, explain most of the uncertainty in Earth system model results; models, empirical data and theory converge when precipitation biases are accounted for. Gross primary productivity, above-ground biomass and tree cover align on a hydrological relationship with a breakpoint at {\textasciitilde}2000\,mm annual precipitation, where the system transitions between water and radiation limitation of evapotranspiration. The breakpoint appears to be fairly stable in the future, suggesting resilience of the Amazon to climate change. Changes in precipitation and land use are therefore more likely to govern biomass and vegetation structure in Amazonia.},

Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite Terrestrial Water Storage (TWSA) estimates offer a promising solution to monitor hydrological drought, but its coarse resolution (1{\textdegree}) limits its applications to small regions of the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). Here we employed machine learning models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to downscale GRACE TWSA from 1{\textdegree} to 0.25{\textdegree}. The findings revealed that the XGBoost model outperformed the ANN model with Nash Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) (0.99), Pearson correlation (R) (0.99), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (5.22 mm), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (2.75 mm) between the predicted and GRACE-derived TWSA. Further, Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI) and WSD (Water Storage Deficit) were used to determine the severity and episodes of droughts, respectively. The results of WSDI exhibited a strong agreement when compared with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at different time scales (1-, 3-, and 6-months) and self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI). Moreover, the IBIS had experienced increasing drought episodes, e.g., eight drought episodes were detected within the years 2010 and 2016 with WSDI of -1.20 and -1.28 and total WSD of -496.99 mm and -734.01 mm, respectively. The Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) model between WSDI and climatic variables indicated that potential evaporation had the largest influence on drought after precipitation. The findings of this study will be helpful for drought-related decision-making in IBIS.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study investigates the ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to perform streamflow prediction at ungauged basins. A set of state-of-the-art, hydrological model-dependent regionalization methods are applied to 148 catchments in northeast North America and compared to an LSTM model that uses the exact same available data as the hydrological models. While conceptual model-based methods attempt to derive parameterizations at ungauged sites from other similar or nearby catchments, the LSTM model uses all available data in the region to maximize the information content and increase its robustness. Furthermore, by design, the LSTM does not require explicit definition of hydrological processes and derives its own structure from the provided data. The LSTM networks were able to clearly outperform the hydrological models in a leave-one-out cross-validation regionalization setting on most catchments in the study area, with the LSTM model outperforming the hydrological models in 93\,\% to 97\,\% of catchments depending on the hydrological model. Furthermore, for up to 78\,\% of the catchments, the LSTM model was able to predict streamflow more accurately on pseudo-ungauged catchments than hydrological models calibrated on the target data, showing that the LSTM model's structure was better suited to convert the meteorological data and geophysical descriptors into streamflow than the hydrological models even calibrated to those sites in these cases. Furthermore, the LSTM model robustness was tested by varying its hyperparameters, and still outperformed hydrological models in regionalization in almost all cases. Overall, LSTM networks have the potential to change the regionalization research landscape by providing clear improvement pathways over traditional methods in the field of streamflow prediction in ungauged catchments.},

  abstract = {Large-scale continuous crop monitoring systems (CMS) are key to detect and manage agricultural production anomalies. Current CMS exploit meteorological and crop growth models, and satellite imagery, but have underutilized legacy sources of information such as operational crop expert surveys with long and uninterrupted records. We argue that crop expert assessments, despite their subjective and categorical nature, capture the complexities of assessing the ``status'' of a crop better than any model or remote sensing retrieval. This is because crop rating data naturally encapsulates the broad expert knowledge of many individual surveyors spread throughout the country, constituting a sophisticated network of ``people as sensors'' that provide consistent and accurate information on crop progress. We analyze data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress and Condition (CPC) survey between 1987 and 2019 for four major crops across the US, and show how to transform the original qualitative data into a continuous, probabilistic variable better suited to quantitative analysis. Although the CPC reflects the subjective perception of many surveyors at different locations, the underlying models that describe the reported crop status are statistically robust and maintain similar characteristics across different crops, exhibit long-term stability, and have nation-wide validity. We discuss the origin and interpretation of existing spatial and temporal biases in the survey data. Finally, we propose a quantitative Crop Condition Index based on the CPC survey and demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason.},

In particular, we present methods for estimating the parameters of the log-logistic distribution for obtaining standardized values, methods for computing reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and weighting kernels used for calculation of the SPEI at different time scales. We discuss the use of alternative ET0 and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) methods and different options on the resulting SPEI series by use of observational and global gridded data. The results indicate that the equation used to calculate ET0 can have a significant effect on the SPEI in some regions of the world. Although the original formulation of the SPEI was based on plotting-positions Probability Weighted Moment (PWM), we now recommend use of unbiased PWM for model fitting. Finally, we present new software tools for computation and analysis of SPEI series, an updated global gridded database, and a real-time drought-monitoring system.},

In contrast, groundwater from the deeper, saturated zone, may contribute a significant proportion of river flow, but its effects on flooding are poorly understood. Here we analyze hydroclimatic records of thousands of North American watersheds spanning 1981{\textendash}2018 to show that baseflow (i.e. groundwater-sustained river flows) affects the magnitude of annual flooding at time scales from days to decades. Annual floods almost always arise through the co-occurrence of high precipitation (rainfall + snowmelt) and baseflow. Flood magnitudes are often more strongly related to variations in antecedent baseflow than antecedent soil moisture and short-term ({$\leq$}3-day) extreme precipitation. In addition, multi-decadal trends in flood magnitude and decadal flood variations tend to better align with groundwater storage and baseflow trends than with changing precipitation extremes and soil moisture. This reveals the importance of groundwater in shaping North American river floods and often decouples the spatial patterns of flood trends from those of shifting precipitation extremes and soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Climate change has led to concerns about increasing river floods resulting from the greater water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere1. These concerns are reinforced by evidence of increasing economic losses associated with flooding in many parts of the world, including Europe2. Any changes in river floods would have lasting implications for the design of flood protection measures and flood risk zoning. However, existing studies have been unable to identify a consistent continental-scale climatic-change signal in flood discharge observations in Europe3, because of the limited spatial coverage and number of hydrometric stations. Here we demonstrate clear regional patterns of both increases and decreases in observed river flood discharges in the past five decades in Europe, which are manifestations of a changing climate. Our results{\textemdash}arising from the most complete database of European flooding so far{\textemdash}suggest that: increasing autumn and winter rainfall has resulted in increasing floods in northwestern Europe; decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in medium and large catchments in southern Europe; and decreasing snow cover and snowmelt, resulting from warmer temperatures, have led to decreasing floods in eastern Europe. Regional flood discharge trends in Europe range from an increase of about 11 per cent per decade to a decrease of 23 per cent. Notwithstanding the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the observational record, the flood changes identified here are broadly consistent with climate model projections for the next century4,5, suggesting that climate-driven changes are already happening and supporting calls for the consideration of climate change in flood risk management.},

Next to a global discrete land cover map at 100 m resolution, a set of cover fraction layers is provided depicting the percentual cover of the main land cover types in a pixel. This additional continuous classification scheme represents areas of heterogeneous land cover better than the standard discrete classification scheme. Overall, 20 layers are provided which allow customization of land cover maps to specific user needs or applications (e.g., forest monitoring, crop monitoring, biodiversity and conservation, climate modeling, etc.). However, Collection 2 was not just a global up-scaling, but also includes major improvements in the map quality, reaching around 80\% or more overall accuracy. The processing system went into operational status allowing annual updates on a global scale with an additional implemented training and validation data collection system. In this paper, we provide an overview of the major changes in the production of the land cover maps, that have led to this increased accuracy, including aligning with the Sentinel 2 satellite system in the grid and coordinate system, improving the metric extraction, adding better auxiliary data, improving the biome delineations, as well as enhancing the expert rules. An independent validation exercise confirmed the improved classification results. In addition to the methodological improvements, this paper also provides an overview of where the different resources can be found, including access channels to the product layer as well as the detailed peer-review product documentation.},

  abstract = {Groundwater levels have been decreasing in most agricultural areas, motivating research to find optimal solutions to balance socio-economical and environmental demands. Traditionally, groundwater optimization aims at long-term profit maximization, while accounting for the extraction costs. Following this approach, we find exploitation protocols characterized by pumping rates that slowly decrease in time toward a long-term sustainable value. However, the comparison of the model prediction with water extraction data for the period 1985{\textendash}2021 from Kern County in California points out the inconsistencies between real management and long-term optimal behavior. Rather, the observed trajectory resembles those obtained by finite-time optimization horizons, which provide short-term high profits by over-drafting, while leading to long-term dilapidation of the capital and the exhaustion of the aquifer. Such myopic planning results in a Ponzi scheme for groundwater extraction. Like the infamous fraudulent scheme, `more-than-optimal' profits are achievable by excessive short-term consumption by the early investors (the past and current aquifer exploiters), leaving the later comers (the future generations) with an impossible cost to sustain. Including the environmental costs of aquifer over-exploitation, the myopic nature of human planning can be corrected and reconciled with a more sustainable use of groundwater.},

  abstract = {Satellite gravity measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide quantitative measurement of terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes with unprecedented accuracy. Combining GRACE-observed TWS changes and independent estimates of water change in soil and snow and surface reservoirs offers a means for estimating groundwater storage change. Since its launch in March 2002, GRACE time-variable gravity data have been successfully used to quantify long-term groundwater storage changes in different regions over the world, including northwest India, the High Plains Aquifer and the Central Valley in the USA, the North China Plain, Middle East, and southern Murray{\textendash}Darling Basin in Australia, where groundwater storage has been significantly depleted in recent years (or decades). It is difficult to rely on in situ groundwater measurements for accurate quantification of large, regional-scale groundwater storage changes, especially at long timescales due to inadequate spatial and temporal coverage of in situ data and uncertainties in storage coefficients. The now nearly 13 years of GRACE gravity data provide a successful and unique complementary tool for monitoring and measuring groundwater changes on a global and regional basis. Despite the successful applications of GRACE in studying global groundwater storage change, there are still some major challenges limiting the application and interpretation of GRACE data. In this paper, we present an overview of GRACE applications in groundwater studies and discuss if and how the main challenges to using GRACE data can be addressed.},

  abstract = {Despite a proven record of accurate floodplain mapping, complex hydrodynamic models lack efficiency due to their data-intensive approach and high computation time. As fast-computing low-complexity alternatives, topography-based hydrogeomorphic approaches are being increasingly used in recent times. Yet, there is little evidence to suggest whether and to what extent such topography-based approaches, simply relying on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), can effectively delineate floodplains/flood hazard zones in data-scarce, highly complex mountainous terrains. We fill this knowledge-gap by conducting a floodplain mapping comparative assessment with three topography-based approaches along a 56-km river reach in the North West Himalayas (Beas River, India). Specifically, we generated floodplain extent using Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), and Slope Position (SP), and estimated their relative differences compared to a reference inundation extent simulated by MIKE11 hydrodynamic model. The unique feature of our study was an extensive field survey to collect longitudinal and cross-sectional elevation data across 223 locations, which allowed us to verify vertical accuracy across multiple alternative DEMs and subsequently improve the selected DEM via bathymetry integration. Statistical measures estimating the degree of consistency across three topography-based approaches suggested that HAND and TWI produce more reasonable floodplain maps than SP. HAND-based floodplain demonstrated greater agreement with the model-simulated reference map. TWI showed moderate predictability with a tendency of underestimating floodplains. SP was largely inconsistent, demarcating floodplains in areas where the hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa. Our study can offer critical insights to support floodplain hydrological, biological, and habitat studies across the world's developing countries where locally relevant delineation of floodplains remains challenging due to data scarcity.},

We argue that the apparent disconnect between estimates in the literature and real-world observation reflects the limitation of studies, methods, and approaches in capturing forest and water relationships' complex nature. Future research should focus on hydrologic parameters other than annual streamflow flow (such as infiltration, groundwater recharge, and flow regulation) and encompass broader spatial{\textendash}temporal scales. More empirical studies are needed, especially in the tropics, as the forest{\textendash}water dynamics in these areas are unique and poorly understood. Filling this gap is critical to improving the decision-making process related to water management and governance.},

The equation is based on Monteith's daily net radiation equation. Empirical equations are also developed to quantify surface albedo and clear sky global transmissivity. The modified Monteith formula for net radiation is tested in coastal, desert, mountain, and interior valley regions within California. After examining the 1984-1989 data from weather stations in the various regions, the absolute mean error of calculated hourly R(n) is within 10\% of the measured hourly R(n).

Recent drying of global endorheic water stores raises concerns over deteriorating migratory pathways, yet few studies have considered these effects at the scale of continental flyways. Here, we investigate the resiliency of waterbird migration networks across western North America by reconstructing long-term patterns (1984-2018) of terminal lake and wetland surface water area in 26 endorheic watersheds. Findings were partitioned regionally by snowmelt- and monsoon-driven hydrologies and combined with climate and human water-use data to determine their importance in predicting surface water trends. Nonlinear patterns of lake and wetland drying were apparent along latitudinal flyway gradients. Pervasive surface water declines were prevalent in northern snowmelt watersheds (lakes -27\%, wetlands -47\%) while largely stable in monsoonal watersheds to the south (lakes -13\%, wetlands +8\%). Monsoonal watersheds represented a smaller proportion of total lake and wetland area, but their distribution and frequency of change within highly arid regions of the continental flyway increased their value to migratory waterbirds. Irrigated agriculture and increasing evaporative demands were the most important drivers of surface water declines. Underlying agricultural and wetland relationships however were more complex. Approximately 7\% of irrigated lands linked to flood irrigation and water storage practices supported 61\% of all wetland inundation in snowmelt watersheds. In monsoonal watersheds, small earthen dams, meant to capture surface runoff for livestock watering, were a major component of wetland resources (67\%) that supported networks of isolated wetlands surrounding endorheic lakes. Ecological trends and human impacts identified herein underscore the importance of assessing flyway-scale change as our model depictions likely reflect new and emerging bottlenecks to continental migration.},

Greater and Gunnison sage-grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus and C. minimus , are adapted to patterns of resource intermittence and rely on stable adult survival supplemented by occasional recruitment pulses when climatic conditions are favorable. Predictions of intensifying water scarcity raise concerns over new demographic bottlenecks impacting sage-grouse populations in drought-sensitive landscapes. We estimate biome-wide mesic resource productivity from 1984 to 2016 using remote sensing to identify patterns of food availability influencing selective pressures on sage-grouse. We linked productivity to abiotic factors to examine effects of seasonal drought across time, space, and land tenure, with findings partitioned along gradients of ecosystem water balance within Great Basin, Rocky Mountains and Great Plains regions. Precipitation was the driver of mesic resource abundance explaining {$\geq$}70\% of variance in drought-limited vegetative productivity. Spatiotemporal shifts in mesic abundance were apparent given biome-wide climatic trends that reduced precipitation below three-quarters of normal in 20\% of years. Drought sensitivity structured grouse populations wherein landscapes with the greatest uncertainty in mesic abundance and distribution supported the fewest grouse. Privately owned lands encompassed 40\% of sage-grouse range, but contained a disproportional 68\% of mesic resources. Regional drought sensitivity identified herein acted as ecological minimums to influence differences in landscape carrying capacity across sage-grouse range. Our model depictions likely reflect a new normal in water scarcity that could compound impacts of demographic bottlenecks in Great Basin and Great Plains. We conclude that long-term population maintenance depends on a diversity of drought resistant mesic resources that offset climate driven variability in vegetative productivity. We recommend a holistic public{\textendash}private lands approach to mesic restoration to offset a deepening risk of water scarcity.},

This app uses a novel multi-linear regression (MLR) algorithm to impute missing data for infrequently sampled wells, using correlated data from other wells in the same aquifer. The app uses this MLR-imputed data to spatially interpolate water levels throughout an aquifer at user-specified time steps using GSLIB Kriging code.

The United Nations Environment Programme, World Bank, and other agencies have called for inclusion of the value of natural capital in sustainability metrics, such as inclusive wealth. Much has been written about the importance of natural capital, but consistent, rigorous valuation approaches compatible with the pricing of traditional forms of capital have remained elusive. We present a guiding quantitative framework enabling natural capital valuation that is fully consistent with capital theory, accounts for biophysical and economic feedbacks, and can guide interdisciplinary efforts to measure sustainability. We illustrate this framework with an application to groundwater in the Kansas High Plains Aquifer, a rapidly depleting asset supporting significant food production. We develop a 10-y time series (1996-2005) of natural capital asset prices that accounts for technological, institutional, and physical changes. Kansas lost approximately \$110 million per year (2005 US dollars) of capital value through groundwater withdrawal and changes in aquifer management during the decade spanning 1996{\textendash}2005. This annual loss in wealth is approximately equal to the state's 2005 budget surplus, and is substantially more than investments in schools over this period. Furthermore, real investment in agricultural capital also declined over this period. Although Kansas' depletion of water wealth is substantial, it may be tractably managed through careful groundwater management and compensating investments in other natural and traditional assets. Measurement of natural capital value is required to inform management and ongoing investments in natural assets.},

  abstract = {Irrigation can be a significant source of groundwater recharge in many agricultural regions, particularly in arid and semi-arid climates. Once infiltrated, irrigation recharge can travel via subsurface flowpaths that return to the river system in a lagged manner, supplementing natural streamflow weeks, months, or even years from when the irrigation was applied. In regions that experience low flows during summer and early fall, return flows can be a significant source of supplementary streamflow. Many water planning and operations models either ignore return flows or roughly approximate them with analytical solutions. Thus, return flows represent an important but often overlooked component of the hydrological exchange and overall water balance in agricultural regions. This study uses groundwater models to explore a wide range of factors that control irrigation return flow timing in irrigated alluvial valleys. A sensitivity analysis approach is used to assess how factors such as the extent of irrigated land adjacent to a stream, irrigation recharge rate, aquifer hydraulic conductivity, aquifer thickness, water table configuration, and seasonal fluctuations in stream stage control the timing of subsurface return flows. Modeling is conducted using MODFLOW models representing an irrigated alluvial valley adjacent to a stream. While a simplification of the full complexity in real systems, the models are a significant advancement from the analytical solution and provide new insight into the timescales of return flows over a broad range of possible conditions. To contextualize our modeling results, they are compared to an analytical solution commonly used for approximating return flows to evaluate its performance. Our findings show what factors and conditions influence return flow timing and control whether they contribute to streamflow over short term (months) or longer term (seasonal) time scales.},

One main concern for the next century is a potential water scarcity triggered by a severe and persistent rainfall shortage. This is one of the climate-driven impacts studied within the EU funded project RESCCUE. To evaluate potential drought scenarios, the Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) hydrological model reproduces the water contributions by month that have reached the reservoirs, regarding the accumulated rainfall over each sub-basin, representing the available historical-observed water levels. For future scenarios, we adjusted the input data set using climate projections of rainfall time series data of the project RESCCUE. Local outputs from 9 different climate models were applied to simulate river basins' responses to reservoirs' incoming water volume. Analyzing these results, we obtained average trends of the models for each scenario, hypothetical extreme values, and quantification for changes in water availability. Future water availability scenarios for Barcelona central water sources showed a mean decrease close to 11\% in comparison with the period 1971{\textendash}2015, considering the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) climate change scenario in the year 2100. This research forecasts a slight downward trend in water availability from rainfall contributions from the mid-21st century. This planned future behavior does not mean that the annual water contributions are getting lower than the current ones, but rather, identifies an escalation in the frequency of drought cycles.},

  abstract = {The current study proposes a new method to downscale the monthly GRACE-derived Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) to 10~km spatial resolution over Iran using deep learning methods. First, the growing neural gas (GNG) method is utilized to cluster the TWSA data to find similar patterns. The Silhouette Chou Davies (SCD) validity measure, a combination of three robust cluster validity measures, is used to evaluate the performance of the GNG method. Then, the feasibility of deep learning Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), shallow learning Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), and Random Forest (RF) are examined in downscaling GRACE-derived TWSA using only remote sensing images. The results indicate that the deep learning method outperforms the RF and FFNN models by 7~\% and 18~\%, respectively. Then, the Ground Water Storage (GWS) data are isolated from TWSA, showing an agreement between the GRACE-derived GWS and ground-based measurements with R2~=~0.76. Additionally, the downscaled TWSA is used to generate annual drought frequency and change detection maps for the GWS from 2002 to 2016. Annual standardized precipitation index (SPI) drought frequency maps are also produced to gain deeper insight into the water resource scarcity of Iran. The results indicate that Iran has experienced water resource overexploitation since 2011 for agricultural activities, while meteorological drought is a trigger and intensifier for the water crisis in Iran. According to the results, Iran experienced exceptional drought in some regions, and the GWS has decreased all over the country. In addition, further analysis of Iran's water resources is provided until 2022. The current study calls for integrated sustainable water resources management in Iran; otherwise, irreversible water and environmental problems with higher frequencies will be expected in the near future.},

We develop a scenario-based analytical framework for estimating the economic impacts of droughts under a range of assumed climate and policy conditions. The scenarios modeled take account of different assumptions regarding a drought event, including: the source of the drought (green or blue water), temporality, and critically, long-term and short-term policy-making choices. Applying the framework to the UK economy we estimate that, depending on the severity of the drought event and short-term policy choices, the impacts could range from 0.35\% to 4.3\% of total output in terms of total production. Different long-term policy choices could mitigate the impacts for drought events with similar severity and duration.},

  abstract = {In Paris, France, December 2015, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide a special report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 {\textdegree}C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. In Nairobi, Kenya, April 2016, the IPCC panel accepted the invitation. Here we describe the response devised within the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) to provide tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impact projections to broaden the scientific basis for the report. The simulation protocol is designed to allow for (1) separation of the impacts of historical warming starting from pre-industrial conditions from impacts of other drivers such as historical land-use changes (based on pre-industrial and historical impact model simulations); (2) quantification of the impacts of additional warming up to 1.5 {\textdegree}C, including a potential overshoot and long-term impacts up to 2299, and comparison to higher levels of global mean temperature change (based on the low-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6 and a no-mitigation pathway RCP6.0) with socio-economic conditions fixed at 2005 levels; and (3) assessment of the climate effects based on the same climate scenarios while accounting for simultaneous changes in socio-economic conditions following the middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2, Fricko et al., 2016) and in particular differential bioenergy requirements associated with the transformation of the energy system to comply with RCP2.6 compared to RCP6.0. With the aim of providing the scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and analysis of cross-sectoral interactions that may dampen or amplify sectoral impacts, the protocol is designed to facilitate consistent impact projections from a range of impact models across different sectors (global and regional hydrology, lakes, global crops, global vegetation, regional forests, global and regional marine ecosystems and fisheries, global and regional coastal infrastructure, energy supply and demand, temperature-related mortality, and global terrestrial biodiversity).},

GRACE observes TWS depletion associated with anthropogenic groundwater extraction in northwest India. The model, however, does not represent anthropogenic groundwater withdrawals and is not skillful in reproducing the interannual variability of groundwater. Assimilation of GRACE TWS introduces long-term trends and improves the interannual variability in groundwater. But the assimilation also introduces a negative trend in simulated evapotranspiration whereas in reality evapotranspiration is likely enhanced by irrigation, which is also unmodeled. Moreover, in situ measurements of shallow groundwater show no trend, suggesting that the trends are erroneously introduced by the assimilation into the modeled shallow groundwater, when in reality the groundwater is depleted in deeper aquifers. The results emphasize the importance of representing anthropogenic processes in land surface modeling and data assimilation systems.},

Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.},

  abstract = {The existence of fewer gauging sites along with sparse network of rain gauges make the monitoring of floods difficult, especially over regions characterized with hydrologic heterogeneity. The availability of observations from satellite sensors makes it possible to study hydrological behaviour of such under-observed river basins. In this study, we explore the utility of GRACE derived terrestrial water storage estimates to monitor the flood events of varying magnitudes over the river basins on Indian Peninsula, that is known to be a region of high heterogeneity. We use terrestrial water storage estimates from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, rainfall and temperature data from India Meteorological Department (IMD), discharge data from Central Water Commission (CWC) and groundwater level data from Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) to evaluate and compare the variability of flood potential of six major river basins, which show unique hydrological characteristics. The flood potential is evaluated for these major basins in Peninsular India using Reager's Flood Potential Index (FPI) and the skill of FPI is assessed over these basins, for the period from 2003 to 2016. Significant variations are observed in the terrestrial water storage and FPI estimates of these basins, which reflects the diverse hydrological behaviour of the basins. Mahanadi basin shows extremely high positive FPI values, while Cauvery basin shows extremely high negative values, thereby confirming their respective flood and drought prone characteristics. The ability of FPI is established especially for basins with discharge values higher than 2000 m3 s{\textendash}1. Moreover, good accuracy ({$>$} 90\%) is observed over Mahanadi, Godavari and Narmada basins that are exposed with frequent mild, moderate and severe floods, using the threshold values of FPI. Among all the basins, Mahanadi basin shows high threshold FPI values of 0.40, 0.32 and 0.27 for severe, moderate and mild floods respectively. Godavari and Narmada basins have relatively lesser thresholds. The FPI values corresponding to severe, moderate and mild floods for Godavari basin are 0.25, 0.14 and 0.09, while those for Narmada basin are 0.25, 0.11 and 0.04. We hence, conclude that the index has the ability to monitor different levels of floods, over basins exhibiting diverse hydrological characteristics. These observations establish that GRACE derived terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) can be used for flood monitoring applications, when discharge data is rarely available and the incorporation of terrestrial water storage estimates with the rainfall data in hydrological modelling may greatly help in assessing hydrological extremes.},

It plays a key role in many processes at the Earth surface, especially the fluxes of matter to soils, ecosystems, rivers, and oceans. Understanding these processes at the global scale requires a high resolution description of lithology. A new high resolution global lithological map (GLiM) was assembled from existing regional geological maps translated into lithological information with the help of regional literature. The GLiM represents the rock types of the Earth surface with 1,235,400 polygons. The lithological classification consists of three levels. The first level contains 16 lithological classes comparable to previously applied definitions in global lithological maps. The additional two levels contain 12 and 14 subclasses, respectively, which describe more specific rock attributes. According to the GLiM, the Earth is covered by 64\% sediments (a third of which are carbonates), 13\% metamorphics, 7\% plutonics, and 6\% volcanics, and 10\% are covered by water or ice. The high resolution of the GLiM allows observation of regional lithological distributions which often vary from the global average. The GLiM enables regional analysis of Earth surface processes at global scales. A gridded version of the GLiM is available at the PANGEA Database (http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.788537).},

We provide benchmarks for this novel dataset with its spectral bands using state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs). With the proposed novel dataset, we achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.57\%. The resulting classification system opens a gate towards a number of Earth observation applications. We demonstrate how this classification system can be used for detecting land use and land cover changes and how it can assist in improving geographical maps.

  abstract = {This paper presents the calibration and evaluation of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), an operational system that produces ensemble streamflow forecasts and threshold exceedance probabilities for large rivers worldwide. The system generates daily streamflow forecasts using a coupled H-TESSEL land surface scheme and the LISFLOOD model forced by ECMWF IFS meteorological forecasts. The hydrology model currently uses a priori parameter estimates with uniform values globally, which may limit the streamflow forecast skill. Here, the LISFLOOD routing and groundwater model parameters are calibrated with ECMWF reforecasts from 1995 to 2015 as forcing using daily streamflow data from 1287 stations worldwide. The calibration of LISFLOOD parameters is performed using an evolutionary optimization algorithm with the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as objective function. The skill improvements are quantified by computing the skill scores as the change in KGE relative to the baseline simulation using a priori parameters. The results show that simulation skill has improved after calibration (KGE skill score\,{$>$}\,0.08) for the large majority of stations during the calibration (67\% globally and 77\% outside of North America) and validation (60\% globally and 69\% outside of North America) periods compared to the baseline simulation. However, the skill gain was impacted by the bias in the baseline simulation (the lowest skill score was obtained in basins with negative bias) due to the limitation of the model in correcting the negative bias in streamflow. Hence, further skill improvements could be achieved by reducing the bias in the streamflow by improving the precipitation forecasts and the land surface model. The results of this work will have implications on improving the operational GloFAS flood forecasting (www.globalfloods.eu).},

BILBI greatly refines the mapping of biodiversity patterns relative to more traditional surrogates such as ecoregions and species range maps.

  abstract = {Human water withdrawal has increasingly altered the global water cycle in past decades, yet our understanding of its driving forces and patterns is limited. Reported historical estimates of sectoral water withdrawals are often sparse and incomplete, mainly restricted to water withdrawal estimates available at annual and country scales, due to a lack of observations at seasonal and local scales. In this study, through collecting and consolidating various sources of reported data and developing spatial and temporal statistical downscaling algorithms, we reconstruct a global monthly gridded (0.5{$\circ$}) sectoral water withdrawal dataset for the period 1971{\textendash}2010, which distinguishes six water use sectors, i.e., irrigation, domestic, electricity generation (cooling of thermal power plants), livestock, mining, and manufacturing. Based on the reconstructed dataset, the spatial and temporal patterns of historical water withdrawal are analyzed. Results show that total global water withdrawal has increased significantly during 1971{\textendash}2010, mainly driven by the increase in irrigation water withdrawal. Regions with high water withdrawal are those densely populated or with large irrigated cropland production, e.g., the United States (US), eastern China, India, and Europe. Seasonally, irrigation water withdrawal in summer for the major crops contributes a large percentage of total annual irrigation water withdrawal in mid- and high-latitude regions, and the dominant season of irrigation water withdrawal is also different across regions. Domestic water withdrawal is mostly characterized by a summer peak, while water withdrawal for electricity generation has a winter peak in high-latitude regions and a summer peak in low-latitude regions. Despite the overall increasing trend, irrigation in the western US and domestic water withdrawal in western Europe exhibit a decreasing trend. Our results highlight the distinct spatial pattern of human water use by sectors at the seasonal and annual timescales. The reconstructed gridded water withdrawal dataset is open access, and can be used for examining issues related to water withdrawals at fine spatial, temporal, and sectoral scales.},

Further, newer wells are not being constructed deeper than older wells in some of the places experiencing significant groundwater level declines, suggesting that newer wells are at least as likely to run dry as older wells if groundwater levels continue to decline. Poor water quality in deep aquifers and the high costs of well construction limit the effectiveness of tapping deep groundwater to stave off the loss of access to water as wells run dry.},

  abstract = {Rising population and industrialisation aided by technological advancements have resulted in increased industrial water demand in India. Industrial water demand accounts for about 8{\textendash}10 \% of the total water demand in the country. Although some national and international organisations report industrial water demand, there is a wide variation in data due to the scarcity of the reliable data and inconsistencies in the methods adopted for quantification. Rather than using these estimates, the census-based statistical data could provide better figures. Therefore, the present study aims to quantify industrial water demand by compiling census-based statistical data collected from various Governmental agencies in India. Based on census datasets collected at National and State Governmental institutions, this study develops a new model to estimate industrial water demand. Industrial water demand is estimated in this study at State and monthly scale from 1991 to 2010. The study models industrial water demand as a function of industrial production data, industrial survey components, and economic/technological development indicators. Principal component analysis is employed to reduce these large number of input variables to a smaller number of latent variables, which account for the variance in the input variables. The model results are cross-validated with industrial water demand data obtained from National Commission on Integrated Water Resources Development (NCIWRD). Country-level estimates are disaggregated to State-level water demand estimates based on number of industrial units in each State. These State-level results are verified against an independent census dataset on industrial water demand collected from State Governmental organisations. It is found that industrial water demand increased at a rate of 2\% per annum during the period of analysis, which exceeds the increase rate of agricultural and domestic water demands during the same period.},

We used 60,000 point samples from 28 years to extract Landsat satellite imagery, as well as climate, meteorology, and terrain data to train a Random Forest classifier. Using a spatially independent validation dataset of 40,000 points, we found our classifier has an overall binary classification (irrigated vs. unirrigated) accuracy of 97.8\%, and a four-class overall accuracy of 90.8\%. We compared our results to Census of Agriculture irrigation estimates over the seven years of available data and found good overall agreement between the 2832 county-level estimates (r     2     = 0.90), and high agreement when estimates are aggregated to the state level (r     2     = 0.94).

While most of the related research has focused on drought as a hazard, it is essential to go beyond such practice and utilize hazard information in integration with vulnerability and resilience. We put forth a multi-dimensional high-resolution assessment of drought risk in Pakistan on a national scale. To this end, we utilize a Drought Risk Index (DRI) based on integrated Drought Hazard (DHI), Drought Vulnerability (DVI), and Drought Resilience (DReI) indices. We further employ geospatial techniques to identify and pinpoint statistically significant clustering in the form of hot and cold spots (higher and lower values concentration, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, this is a preliminary effort to engage the state-of-the-art space{\textendash}time pattern mining technique for the simultaneous spatial{\textendash}temporal dynamics investigation of droughts. We observed varying north{\textendash}south geographical distributions in DHI across the country with higher drought intensities in southern regions. While a sizeable spatial drought risk disparity is evident across Pakistan, the worst DRI results are seen in Balochistan, followed by Sindh. Notably, around one-third of the country is identified as the hot spot with the highest drought risk, which ascertains a grave situation under global warming. Our comprehensive results provide more insights to prepare for drought mitigation, adaptation measures, and systematic impact evaluation in the face of environmental changes.},

  abstract = {When using GRACE as a tool for hydrology, many different gravity field model products are now available to the end user. The traditional spherical harmonics solutions produced from GRACE are typically obtained through an optimization of the gravity field data at the global scale, and are generated by a number of processing centers around the world. Alternatives to this global approach include so-called regional techniques, for which many variants exist, but whose common trait is that they only use the gravity data collected over the area of interest to generate the solution. To determine whether these regional solutions hold any advantage over the global techniques in terms of overall accuracy, a range of comparisons were made using some of the more widely used regional and global methods currently available. The regional techniques tested made use of either spherical radial basis functions or single layer densities (i.e., mascons), with the global solutions having been obtained from the various major processing centers. The solutions were evaluated using a range of computed statistics over a selection of major river basins, which were globally distributed and ranged in size from 1 to 6~million~km2. For one of the basins tested, the Zambezi, additional validation tests were conducted through comparisons against a custom designed regional hydrology model of the region. We could not prove that current regional models perform better than global ones. Monthly mean water storage variations agree at the level of 0.02~m equivalent water height. The differences in terms of monthly mean water storage variations between regional and global solutions are comparable with the differences among only global or regional solutions. Typically they reach values of 0.02~m equivalent water heights, which seems to be the level of accuracy of current GRACE solutions for river basins above 1~million~km2. The amplitudes of the seasonal mass variations agree at the sub-centimetre level. Evident from all of the comparisons shown is the importance that the choice of regularization, or spatial filtering, can have on the solution quality. This was found to be true for global as well as regional techniques.},

  abstract = {Despite the proliferation of computer-based research on hydrology and water resources, such research is typically poorly reproducible. Published studies have low reproducibility due to incomplete availability of data and computer code, and a lack of documentation of workflow processes. This leads to a lack of transparency and efficiency because existing code can neither be quality controlled nor reused. Given the commonalities between existing process-based hydrologic models in terms of their required input data and preprocessing steps, open sharing of code can lead to large efficiency gains for the modeling community. Here, we present a model configuration workflow that provides full reproducibility of the resulting model instantiations in a way that separates the model-agnostic preprocessing of specific data sets from the model-specific requirements that models impose on their input files. We use this workflow to create large-domain (global and continental) and local configurations of the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) hydrologic model connected to the mizuRoute routing model. These examples show how a relatively complex model setup over a large domain can be organized in a reproducible and structured way that has the potential to accelerate advances in hydrologic modeling for the community as a whole. We provide a tentative blueprint of how community modeling initiatives can be built on top of workflows such as this. We term our workflow the ``Community Workflows to Advance Reproducibility in Hydrologic Modeling'' (CWARHM; pronounced ``swarm'').},

  abstract = {Semi-arid and arid systems cover one third of the earth's land surface, and are becoming increasingly drier, but existing datasets do not capture all of the types of water resources that sustain these systems. In semi-arid environments, small surface water bodies and areas of mesic vegetation (wetlands, wet meadows, riparian zones) function as critical water resources. However, the most commonly-used maps of water resources are derived fromthe Landsat time series or single date aerial photographs, and are too coarse either spatially or temporally to effectively monitor water resource dynamics. In this study, we produced a Sentinel Fusion (SF) water resources product for a semi-arid mountainous region of the western United States, which includes monthly maps of both a) surface water and b) mesic vegetation at 10~m spatial resolution using freely available Earth observation data on an open access platform. We applied random forest classifiers to optical data from the Sentinel-2 time series, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 time series, and topographic variables. We compared our SF product with three commonly used and publicly available datasets in the western U.S. We found that our surface water class contained fewer omission errors than a leading global surface water product in (94~\% producer's accuracy (PA) vs 84~\%) and comparable user's accuracy (UA) (91~\% vs 97~\%) with commission errors occurring largely in mixed water pixels. Our mesic vegetation class had up to 43~\% higher PAs compared to the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) estimates and up to 78~\% higher UAs over the Sage Grouse Initiative mesic resources maps during the most critical part of the water year. We found that while inclusion of SAR data from the C-band Sentinel-1 sensor consistently improved estimates of water resources in each of the last four months of the 2021 water year when compared to optical-only~+~topographic variables, only in September did those improvements lie outside of the 95~\% confidence interval. With nine times finer spatial resolution and more frequent image collection, our SF maps characterize intra-annual dynamics of smaller water bodies ({$<$}30~m wide) and mesic vegetation integral to ecosystem functioning in semi-arid systems compared to leading Landsat-derived products. Further, our workflow is easily reproducible using freely available data on an open access platform, and can be adopted to help guide land use decisions related to water resources by farmers, ranchers, and conservationists in semi-arid environments.},

Caravan includes meteorological forcing data, streamflow data, and static catchment attributes (e.g., geophysical, sociological, climatological) for 6830 catchments. Most importantly, Caravan is both a dataset and open-source software that allows members of the hydrology community to extend the dataset to new locations by extracting forcing data and catchment attributes in the cloud. Our vision is for Caravan to democratize the creation and use of globally-standardized large-sample hydrology datasets. Caravan is a truly global open-source community resource.},

The challenge is to filter unclear or conflicting signals from various climatic and socio-economic variables and link them to food security outcomes. Integrating lag-1 autocorrelation diagnostics into remotely sensed observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and food prices, we found dramatic improvement in anticipating the timing and intensity of food crises, except in conflict settings. We analysed drought-induced food crises globally in the SMAP record (since 2015; approximately five per year). The change in soil moisture autocorrelation, which we term the Soil Moisture Auto-Regressive Threshold (SMART), signalled an accurate food security transition for all cases studied here (P\,{$<$}\,0.05; n\,=\,212), including lead time of up to three to six months for every case. The SMART trigger anticipates the timing of the transition and the magnitude of the food security change among small to large transitions, both into and out of crises (R2\,=\,0.80{\textendash}0.83). While we do not evaluate out-of-sample forecast accuracy using our model, our findings suggest a significant advancement in the capabilities of food security early-warning diagnostics and could save lives and resources.},

Global warming of 2{\textdegree}C relative to preindustrial conditions is projected to lead to a more than fivefold increase in cross-category aggregate exposure globally. Changes in exposure are unevenly distributed, with tropical and subtropical regions facing larger increases than higher latitudes.

However, although irrigation efficiency may appear to be a simple measure of performance and imply dramatic positive benefits, it is not straightforward to understand, measure or apply. For example, hydrological understanding that irrigation losses recycle back to surface and groundwater in river basins attempts to account for scale, but this generalisation cannot be readily translated from one location to another or be considered neutral for farmers sharing local irrigation networks. Because irrigation efficiency (IE) motives, measures, effects and technologies play out at different scales for different people, organisations and purposes, and losses differ from place to place and over time, IE is a contested term, highly changeable and subjective. This makes generalisations for science, management and policy difficult. Accordingly, we propose new definitions for IE and irrigation hydrology and introduce a framework, termed an `irrigation efficiency matrix', comprising five spatial scales and ten dimensions to understand and critique the promises, pitfalls and paradoxes of IE and to unlock its utility for addressing contemporary water challenges.},

Being able to adequately close the water budget gives confidence in our ability to model and/or observe the spatio-temporal variations in the water cycle and its components. Due to advances in observation techniques, satellite sensors, and modelling, a number of data products are available that represent the components of water budget in both space and time. Despite these advances, closure of the water budget at the global scale has been elusive.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In this study, we attempt to close the global water budget using precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff data at the catchment scale. The large number of recent state-of-the-art datasets provides a new evaluation of well-used datasets. These estimates are compared to terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes as measured by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We investigated 189 river basins covering more than 90 \% of the continental land area. TWS changes derived from the water balance equation were compared against GRACE data using two metrics: the Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and the cyclostationary NSE. These metrics were used to assess the performance of more than 1600 combinations of the various datasets considered.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We found a positive NSE and cyclostationary NSE in 99 \% and 62 \% of the basins examined respectively. This means that TWS changes reconstructed from the water balance equation were more accurate than the long-term (NSE) and monthly (cyclostationary NSE) mean of GRACE time series in the corresponding basins. By analysing different combinations of the datasets that make up the water balance, we identified data products that performed well in certain regions based on, for example, climatic zone. We identified that some of the good results were obtained due to the cancellation of errors in poor estimates of water budget components. Therefore, we used coefficients of variation to determine the relative quality of a data product, which helped us to identify bad combinations giving us good results. In general, water budget components from ERA5-Land and the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) performed better than other products for most climatic zones. Conversely, the latest version of CLSM, v2.2, performed poorly for evapotranspiration in snow-dominated catchments compared, for example, with its predecessor and other datasets available. Thus, the nature of the catchment dynamics and balance between components affects the optimum combination of datasets. For regional studies, the combination of datasets that provides the most realistic TWS for a basin will depend on its climatic conditions and factors that cannot be determined a priori. We believe that the results of this study provide a road map for studying the water budget at catchment scale.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The global food and water crises caused by climate warming are becoming increasingly significant. One of the important aspects of surface water transfer is evapotranspiration. The accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance in water resource management. However, accurate estimation of large-scale ET is challenging due to the adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels, the heterogeneity of the subsurface and the instability of the lower atmosphere. Therefore, in this paper, a surface energy balance model (Y-SEBAL) was proposed based on the SEBAL model and improved sensible heat flux calculation, and used to simulate large-scale actual evapotranspiration. Based on the principle of surface energy balance, this model introduced the empirical formula of sensible heat flux and simplifies the selection of limit to address the challenge of calculating the sensible heat flux of the crucial variable in the SEBAL model. The study simulated the spatial and temporal evolution of regional evapotranspiration with the model and verified the model simulation performance. In addition, the sensitivity of the model-driven data was quantified. The results showed that the simulation value of the Y-SEBAL model is highly consistent with the eddy covariance measurement data. In the verification results, the R value was 0.82, the index of agreement was 0.9, and the root mean square error was 0.81 mm{$\cdot$}d-1. The performance verification indices were better than the SEBAL model, MOD16 model, and SSEBop model. And the model had the highest sensitivity to wind speed, reaching 0.714. The Y-SEBAL model improved the simulation performance of the original model and simulated the actual evapotranspiration. The study can provide a new solution for improving the retrieval of evapotranspiration by remote sensing at the regional scale.},

We present a transformative hydro-economic model of agricultural production driven by multi-sensor satellite observations, outputs from regional climate models, and socioeconomic data. Our approach overcomes the limitations of current decision support systems for agricultural water management and provides policymakers and natural resource managers with satellite data-driven, state-wide, operational models capable of anticipating how farmers allocate water, land, and other resources when confronted with new climate patterns, policy rules, or market signals. The model can also quantify how farming decisions affect agricultural water supplies. We demonstrate the model through an application in the state of Montana.},

In this paper, we examine the development of instream flow legislation and the evolution of drought planning to highlight the growing concern for the non-human impacts of water scarcity. Utilizing a new framework for ecological drought, we analyzed five watershed-scale drought plans in southwestern Montana, USA to understand if, and how, the ecological impacts of drought are currently being assessed. We found that while these plans do account for some ecological impacts, it is primarily through the narrow lens of impacts to fish as measured by water temperature and streamflow. The latter is typically based on the same ecological principles used to determine instream flow requirements. We also found that other resource plans in the same watersheds (e.g., Watershed Restoration Plans, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Watershed Assessments or United States Forest Service (USFS) Forest Plans) identify a broader range of ecological drought risks. Given limited resources and the potential for mutual benefits and synergies, we suggest greater integration between various planning processes could result in a more holistic consideration of water needs and uses across the landscape.},

  abstract = {In this study a new procedure to address the optimization of the location and selection of pumps as turbines (PATs) within irrigation networks is presented in order to reduce network pressure and recover energy. The proposed procedure consists of two steps: in the first step the optimization of the location of devices is performed, then the optimal selection and regulation is investigated in the second step. Two new mixed integer non-linear models have been developed and a global optimization solver has been employed to perform both optimization procedures. The procedure has been tested on a real irrigation network in Spain. The entire 2015 irrigation season has been used to properly model the water demand within the system. According to the results, the optimal solution consists of 5 PATs, installed in the middle region of the system. The investment cost has been estimated as 169,278 {\texteuro} with a payback period of almost 4.2 irrigation seasons. According to the solution, the effective amount of produced energy is equal to 289 MWh if the system is properly regulated and the pressure exceeding the minimum requirements is exploited to produce energy. Compared to other studies in literature focused on irrigated agriculture, the number of PATs is not fixed but rather it results from the maximization of the energy recovery and the minimization of capital costs, simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed procedure relies on a deterministic approach, achieving promising results in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The full ERA5-Land hourly ({$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx81"{$>$}Mu{\~n}oz-Sabater{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx81"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$><$}a href="\#bib1.bibx81"{$>$}a{$<$}/a{$>$}) and monthly ({$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx82"{$>$}Mu{\~n}oz-Sabater{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx82"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$><$}a href="\#bib1.bibx82"{$>$}b{$<$}/a{$>$}) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Recent experiments applying deep learning to rainfall-runoff simulation indicate that there is significantly more information in large-scale hydrological data sets than hydrologists have been able to translate into theory or models. While there is a growing interest in machine learning in the hydrological sciences community, in many ways, our community still holds deeply subjective and nonevidence-based preferences for models based on a certain type of ``process understanding'' that has historically not translated into accurate theory, models, or predictions. This commentary is a call to action for the hydrology community to focus on developing a quantitative understanding of where and when hydrological process understanding is valuable in a modeling discipline increasingly dominated by machine learning. We offer some potential perspectives and preliminary examples about how this might be accomplished.},

  abstract = {The steady overexploitation of the Ogallala Aquifer underlying the U.S. High Plains Region has put irrigated crop production at risk, particularly in the Southern and Central High Plains. To manage this issue properly, a datadriven modeling framework is developed and tested that is fast to employ and yet provides reliable long-term groundwater level (GWL) forecasts as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors. The modeling framework uses the random forests (RF) technique in combination with ordinary kriging, and is tested in Finney County in southwest Kansas. The introduction of groundwater withdrawal potential as a new surrogate for pumping intensity enables the RF model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system pro\- gresses towards aquifer depletion and/or as a result of well retirement policies. The RF model is executed from 2017 to 2099 for 20 different downscaled global climate models (GCMs) for the two representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios of 4.5 and 8.5. The results show the aquifer will cease to support irrigated agriculture in most of the county by 2060 under status quo management and average climate conditions. Moreover, climate will likely shift the aquifer's depletion time frame by 15 years or less in most of the study area. The long-term combined impact of well retirement plans and climate conditions on groundwater depletion trends imply well retirement policies do not lead to sustained groundwater savings. This study demonstrates the capacity of ma\- chine learning models to serve as a rapid assessment tool, informing policymakers about future groundwater availability in intensively irrigated regions and under different climate and management conditions.},

This paper applies hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting annual groundwater levels in 403 wells of the Ogallala Aquifer. First, the methodology employed HCA to cluster homogeneous wells based on the time series of groundwater levels. Then, the study calibrated an ANN model for each cluster (composed of one or more wells) using previous annual values of groundwater levels as input. The HCA results showed a particular pattern in the spatial distribution of the 30 found clusters, revealing that the Ogallala Aquifer holds higher groundwater levels in the western part, which gradually decrease, advancing to the east. The ANN models provided proper predictions even for wells outside of the calibration data set. This investigation concludes that the integration of HCA and ANN enabled single models to accurately forecast annual groundwater levels for sets of wells in the Ogallala Aquifer.},

We therefore compiled the most recent continental scale information on soil, land use, geology, hydrogeology and climate in a Geographical Information System (GIS) at a resolution of 15km{\texttimes}15km and at the scale of 1:60,000,000. The groundwater vulnerability map was constructed by means of the DRASTIC method. The map reveals that groundwater is highly vulnerable in Central and West Africa, where the watertable is very low. In addition, very low vulnerability is found in the large sedimentary basins of the African deserts where groundwater is situated in very deep aquifers. The groundwater pollution risk map is obtained by overlaying the DRASTIC vulnerability map with land use. The northern, central and western part of the African continent is dominated by high pollution risk classes and this is very strongly related to shallow groundwater systems and the development of agricultural activities. Subsequently, we performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of each parameter on groundwater vulnerability and pollution risk. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the removal of the impact of vadose zone, the depth of the groundwater, the hydraulic conductivity and the net recharge causes a large variation in the mapped vulnerability and pollution risk. The mapping model was validated using nitrate concentration data of groundwater as a proxy of pollution risk. Pan-African concentration data were inferred from a meta-analysis of literature data. Results shows a good match between nitrate concentration and the groundwater pollution risk classes. The pan African assessment of groundwater vulnerability and pollution risk is expected to be of particular value for water policy and for designing groundwater resources management programs. We expect, however, that this assessment can be strongly improved when better pan African monitoring data related to groundwater pollution will be integrated in the assessment methodology.},

  abstract = {As the water requirement for food production and other human needs grows, quantification of environmental flow requirements (EFRs) is necessary to assess the amount of water needed to sustain freshwater ecosystems. EFRs are the result of the quantification of water necessary to sustain the riverine ecosystem, which is calculated from the mean of an environmental flow (EF) method. In this study, five EF methods for calculating EFRs were compared with 11 case studies of locally assessed EFRs. We used three existing methods (Smakhtin, Tennant, and Tessmann) and two newly developed methods (the variable monthly flow method (VMF) and the Q90\_Q50 method). All methods were compared globally and validated at local scales while mimicking the natural flow regime. The VMF and the Tessmann methods use algorithms to classify the flow regime into high, intermediate, and low-flow months and they take into account intra-annual variability by allocating EFRs with a percentage of mean monthly flow (MMF). The Q90\_Q50 method allocates annual flow quantiles (Q90 and Q50) depending on the flow season. The results showed that, on average, 37\% of annual discharge was required to sustain environmental flow requirement. More water is needed for environmental flows during low-flow periods (46{\textendash}71\% of average low-flows) compared to high-flow periods (17{\textendash}45\% of average high-flows). Environmental flow requirements estimates from the Tennant, Q90\_Q50, and Smakhtin methods were higher than the locally calculated EFRs for river systems with relatively stable flows and were lower than the locally calculated EFRs for rivers with variable flows. The VMF and Tessmann methods showed the highest correlation with the locally calculated EFRs (R2=0.91). The main difference between the Tessmann and VMF methods is that the Tessmann method allocates all water to EFRs in low-flow periods while the VMF method allocates 60\% of the flow in low-flow periods. Thus, other water sectors such as irrigation can withdraw up to 40\% of the flow during the low-flow season and freshwater ecosystems can still be kept in reasonable ecological condition. The global applicability of the five methods was tested using the global vegetation and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land (LPJmL) hydrological model. The calculated global annual EFRs for fair ecological conditions represent between 25 and 46\% of mean annual flow (MAF). Variable flow regimes, such as the Nile, have lower EFRs (ranging from 12 to 48\% of MAF) than stable tropical regimes such as the Amazon (which has EFRs ranging from 30 to 67\% of MAF).},

  abstract = {As the first stewards and scientists, Indigenous Peoples have collected data on land relationships across homelands since time immemorial. Settler-colonial experiences have associated data and maps as tools of dispossession, disparity, and disempowerment. Today, however, Indigenous-led statistics and mapping efforts yield powerful tools for Nations in addressing the interconnected wellness of Indigenous biosystems, lands, and people while honoring collectively held knowledge and community protocols. This article details both quantitative and qualitative Indigenous research, with geospatial methodologies of the Amskapi Piikani (Blackfeet Nation), in the creation of the Amskapi Piikani Nation's first well-being index. The Piikani Well-being Index (PWI), generated by this project, is grounded in cultural values and informed by traditional and current knowledge(s) defining 80 variables. The PWI encompasses areas of human health, agriculture and food sovereignty, cultural systems, social and educational lifeways, environmental stewardship, institutions and governance, economics, and land tenure to include traditional land use and Native land revitalization after centuries of systematic oppression, assimilation policies, structural inequities, and trauma. This project navigates data sovereignty challenges while mobilizing data generated by the Nation's first Indigenous land use census. Offering new insights for our Tribal leaders and organizations at nation, local, and watershed scales, the PWI represents an Indigenous system view to better build community research agendas and action. This article discusses the challenges incurred in data collection and use while identifying areas of future work determining metrics and tools to cover the environmental, social, economic, and health research needs of Indigenous communities through data sovereignty.},

While historical TWS variations have been increasingly studied, future changes in TWS and the linkages to droughts remain unexamined. Here, using ensemble hydrological simulations, we show that climate change could reduce TWS in many regions, especially those in the Southern Hemisphere. Strong inter-ensemble agreement indicates high confidence in the projected changes that are driven primarily by climate forcing rather than land and water management activities. Declines in TWS translate to increases in future droughts. By the late twenty-first century, the global land area and population in extreme-to-exceptional TWS drought could more than double, each increasing from 3\% during 1976{\textendash}2005 to 7\% and 8\%, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of climate change mitigation to avoid adverse TWS impacts and increased droughts, and the need for improved water resource management and adaptation.},

  abstract = {As research recognizes the importance of ecological impacts of drought to natural and human communities, drought planning processes need to better incorporate ecological impacts. Drought planning currently recognizes the vulnerability of some ecological impacts from drought (e.g., loss of instream flow affecting fish populations). However, planning often does not identify all the ecological aspects in a landscape that stakeholders value, nor does it examine the extent to which those aspects are vulnerable to drought. One approach for identifying ecological aspects is ecosystem services (ES){\textemdash}that is, the benefits humans receive from nature. To incorporate ecological impacts into drought planning in the Upper Missouri Headwaters (UMH) region (Montana, USA), we combined ES elicitation using the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services and a vulnerability assessment using semi-structured interviews. We juxtaposed results from the interviews and the ES elicitation to assess which ES might be vulnerable to drought and which impacts from interviews were associated with losses of ES. While both methods suggested common drought vulnerabilities, each method also suggested drought vulnerabilities not reported using the other method. The ES elicitation produced more detail about services present in the UMH ecosystem today while interviews resulted in more discussion about ecological transformation from future droughts. Results suggest that some combination of open-ended vulnerability assessment methods and ES elicitation using a structured framework can result in greater understanding of ecological drought vulnerability in a given region.},

Over the GRACE record length, instances of repeated maxima in water storage anomaly that fall short of variable maxima in cumulative precipitation suggest an effective storage capacity for a given region, beyond which additional precipitation must be met by marked increases in runoff or evaporation. These saturation periods indicate the possible transition to a flood-prone situation. To investigate spatially and temporally variable storage overflow, a monthly storage deficit variable is created and a global map of effective storage capacity is presented for possible use in land surface models. To highlight a flood-potential application, we design a monthly global flood index and compare with Dartmouth Flood Observatory flood maps.},

We find irrigation of cattle-feed crops to be the greatest consumer of river water in the western United States, implicating beef and dairy consumption as the leading driver of water shortages and fish imperilment in the region. We assess opportunities for alleviating water scarcity by reducing cattle-feed production, finding that temporary, rotational fallowing of irrigated feed crops can markedly reduce water shortage risks and improve ecological sustainability. Long-term water security and river ecosystem health will ultimately require Americans to consume less beef that depends on irrigated feed crops.},

Most maps of ``water risk'' do not account for the role of infrastructure and rely on local runoff metrics, which may be a poor proxy for experienced water stress. We present a new spatial and multi-sectoral optimization model of resource networks, applied here to water resources in the United States. The model, AWASH, includes a detailed representation of surface water and reservoirs, and relates water risk directly to failures to meet water demand as a function of climate. We find that considering the role of water conveyance and storage infrastructure in managing supply leads to a radically different picture of water risk, with substantial reductions due to both types of infrastructure {\textendash} up to 60\% reduction in risk due to conveyance and 38\% due to storage. This highlights the importance of accounting of the role of infrastructure in national climate risk assessment and adaptation strategies.},

Most hydrologists were sceptical of the satellite gravimetry approach at first, but validation studies assuaged their concerns and high-profile, GRACE-based groundwater depletion studies caused an explosion of interest. The importance of GRACE observations for hydrologic and cryospheric science became so great that GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) jumped the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth science mission queue and launched in 2018. A third mass change mission is currently under development. Here, we review key milestones in satellite gravimetry's progression from the fringes of hydrology to being a staple of large-scale water cycle and water resources studies and the sole source of observations of what is now an `essential climate variable', terrestrial water storage.},

The ill-posed GRACE estimation problem causes the unconstrained GRACE RL05 solutions to have north-south stripes. We discuss the development of global equal area mascon solutions to improve the GRACE gravity information for the study of Earth surface processes. These regularized mascon solutions are developed with a 1{\textdegree} resolution using Tikhonov regularization in a geodesic grid domain. These solutions are derived from GRACE information only, and no external model or data is used to inform the constraints. The regularization matrix is time variable and will not bias or attenuate future regional signals to some past statistics from GRACE or other models. The resulting Center for Space Research (CSR) mascon solutions have no stripe errors and capture all the signals observed by GRACE within the measurement noise level. The solutions are not tailored for specific applications and are global in nature. This study discusses the solution approach and compares the resulting solutions with postprocessed results from the RL05 spherical harmonic solutions and other global mascon solutions for studies of Arctic ice sheet processes, ocean bottom pressure variation, and land surface total water storage change. This suite of comparisons leads to the conclusion that the mascon solutions presented here are an enhanced representation of the RL05 GRACE solutions and provide accurate surface-based gridded information that can be used without further processing.},

This study reports the results from 211 responses to a web-based survey of calibration practices. The survey questions covered multiple choices that are required when doing a calibration exercise. Concerning data, most respondents used field data, but regional data and a combination of field and regional data were also used. Almost all respondents used multiple data types, the most common being phenology and yield data. The median number of estimated parameters was 6, and often this number was only slightly smaller than the number of environments that provided the data. Most respondents fit the data in multiple stages, starting in most cases with phenology data. Many respondents searched for parameter values that minimized a sum of squared errors, but substantial groups used an ad hoc measure of goodness-of-fit, the GLUE method, a weighted least squares method or a Bayesian approach. Nearly half the respondents simply used trial-and-error to search for the best-fit parameters. The other respondents were split more or less equally between those who used existing software and those who wrote new software. Slightly less than half the respondents obtained information on parameter uncertainty. Model evaluation was based on goodness-of-fit or data splitting or cross validation. The median time devoted to crop model calibration was 25 days. Based on these results, a list of topics that should be covered in guidelines for calibration is suggested.},

This paper discusses the development and demonstration of an automated calibration tool for HSPF (HSPF-SCE). HSPF-SCE was developed using the open source software ``R''. The tool employs the Shuffled Complex Evolution optimization algorithm (SCE-UA) to produce a pool of qualified calibration parameter sets from which the modeler chooses a single set of calibrated parameters. Six calibration criteria specified in the Expert System for the Calibration of HSPF (HSPEXP) decision support tool were combined to develop a single, composite objective function for HSPF-SCE. The HSPF-SCE tool was demonstrated, and automated and manually calibrated model performance were compared using three Virginia watersheds, where HSPF models had been previously prepared for bacteria total daily maximum load (TMDL) development. The example applications demonstrate that HSPF-SCE can be an effective tool for calibrating HSPF.},

  abstract = {Detecting long-term change in seasonal precipitation using ground observations is dependent on the representativity of the point measurement to the surrounding landscape. In mountainous regions, representativity can be poor and lead to large uncertainties in precipitation estimates at high elevations or in areas where observations are sparse. If the uncertainty in the estimate is large compared to the long-term shifts in precipitation, then the change will likely go undetected. In this analysis, we examine the mini-mum detectable change across mountainous terrain in western Montana, USA. We ask the question: What is the minimum amount of change that is necessary to be detected using our best estimates of precipitation in complex terrain? We evaluate the spatial uncertainty in the precipitation estimates by conditioning his-toric regional climate model simulations to ground observations using Bayesian inference. By using this uncertainty as a null hypothesis, we test for detectability across the study region. To provide context for the detectability calculations, we look at a range of future scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble downscaled to 4 km resolution using the MACAv2-METDATA data set. When using the ensemble averages we find that approximately 65\% of the significant increases in win-ter precipitation go undetected at midelevations. At high elevation, approximately 75\% of significant increases in winter precipitation are undetectable. Areas where change can be detected are largely con-trolled by topographic features. Elevation and aspect are key characteristics that determine whether or not changes in winter precipitation can be detected. Furthermore, we find that undetected increases in winter precipitation at high elevation will likely remain as snow under climate change scenarios. Therefore, there is potential for these areas to offset snowpack loss at lower elevations and confound the effects of climate change on water resources.},

However, traditional restoration approaches are often intensive and costly, limiting the extent over which they can be applied. Practitioners are increasingly trying new restoration techniques that are more cost-effective, less intensive, and can more practically scale up to the scope of degradation. Unfortunately, practitioners typically lack resources to undertake outcome-based evaluations necessary to judge the efficacy of these techniques. In this study, we use freely available, satellite remote sensing to explore changes in vegetation productivity (normalized difference vegetation index) of three distinct, low-tech, riparian and wet meadow restoration projects. Case studies are presented that range in geographic location (Colorado, Oregon, and Nevada), restoration practice (Zeedyk structures, beaver dam analogs, and grazing management), and time since implementation. Restoration practices resulted in increased vegetation productivity of up to 25\% and increased annual persistence of productive vegetation. Improvements in productivity with time since restoration suggest that elevated resilience may further enhance wildlife habitat and increase forage production. Long-term, documented outcomes of conservation are rare; we hope our findings empower practitioners to further monitor and explore the use of low-tech methods for restoration of ecohydrologic processes at meaningful spatial scales.},

Climate models are our primary tool for projecting the future hydroclimate that society in these regions must adapt to, but here, we present a concerning discrepancy between observed and model-based historical hydroclimate trends. Over the arid/semi-arid regions of the world, the predominant signal in all model simulations is an increase in atmospheric water vapor, on average, over the last four decades, in association with the increased water vapor{\textendash}holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere. In observations, this increase in atmospheric water vapor has not happened, suggesting that the availability of moisture to satisfy the increased atmospheric demand is lower in reality than in models in arid/semi-arid regions. This discrepancy is most clear in locations that are arid/semi-arid year round, but it is also apparent in more humid regions during the most arid months of the year. It indicates a major gap in our understanding and modeling capabilities which could have severe implications for hydroclimate projections, including fire hazard, moving forward.},

The Mann{\textendash}Kendall test for monotonic trends and the CUSUM test are used to determine the presence or absence of changes in climatic variables, shallow groundwater level, and streamflow. Time series are explored to detect the direction of trends and the period when the significant change occurred. Differences in climatic conditions and streamflow patterns are discussed for two sub-periods, before and after the change. Overall, the results suggest stability in precipitation, with limited evidence for change in the annual amount, but reveal a significant change in streamflow regime in the 1980s, attributed to higher temperature driving evapotranspiration and reducing shallow groundwater recharge. It is concluded that the catchment is prone to increased evapotranspiration and in effect to greatly reduced runoff.},

Approximately 2.6 billion people live in river basins where groundwater is needed because they are already outside the surface water ESB or have insufficient surface water to meet human needs and the ESB. Approximately 1.4 billion people live in river basins where demand-side transformations would be required as they either exceed the surface water ESB or face a decline in groundwater recharge and cannot meet minimum needs within the ESB. A further 1.5 billion people live in river basins outside the ESB, with insufficient surface water to meet minimum needs, requiring both supply- and demand-side transformations.

Over the past 40 years climate science has provided a major contribution to improved understanding of the reasons for this high level of climatic variability with advances in seasonal forecasting research providing incentives for primary producers to adopt a more self-reliant approach to their farming operations, including drought preparedness. Over 20 major scientific publications pointed to aspects of the key climatic mechanisms {\textendash} mainly associated with the El Ni{\~n}o phenomenon {\textendash} that were now known to be responsible for drought events in Australia. Some of these publications also pointed to the means of forecasting such extreme climate events which implied the potential to prepare for drought events. Coincident enhancement of farming technologies over this period further enabled producers to create more drought resilient systems. Australian Governments have also provided many incentives to improve self-reliance and farm management and so assist preparedness for the poorer (drought) seasons and years when they occur. Government policy development over this period has been conducted with an awareness of all these factors and has therefore been able to provide changes in drought assistance through new policy endeavours that are probably unequalled in the world. This paper presents insights to the scientific, technological, and policy aspects of managing drought in Australia.},

The {$\sim$}1-year data gap between the two GRACE missions needs to be filled to maintain data continuity and maximize mission benefits. In this study, we applied an automated machine learning (AutoML) workflow to perform gridwise GRACE-like data reconstruction. AutoML represents a new paradigm for optimal algorithm selection, model structure selection, and hyperparameter tuning, addressing some of the most challenging issues in machine learning applications. We demonstrated the workflow over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) using six types of machine learning models and multiple groups of meteorological and climatic variables as predictors. Results indicate that the AutoML-assisted gap filling achieved satisfactory performance over the CONUS. On the testing data, the mean gridwise Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency is around 0.85, the mean correlation coefficient is around 0.95, and the mean normalized root-mean-square-error is about 0.09. Trained models maintain good performance when extrapolating to the mission gap and to GRACE-FO periods (after June 2017). Results further suggest that no single algorithm provides the best predictive performance over the entire CONUS, stressing the importance of using an end-to-end workflow to train, optimize, and combine multiple machine learning models to deliver robust performance, especially when building large-scale hydrological prediction systems and when predictor importance exhibiting strong spatial variability.},

Here we characterize spatial-temporal variations in terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) from GRACE and compare them to those simulated with the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Additionally, we use GLDAS simulations to infer how TWSC is partitioned into snow, canopy water and soil water components, and to understand how variations in the hydrologic fluxes act to enhance or dissipate the stores. Results quantify the range of GRACE-derived storage changes during the studied period and place them in the context of seasonal variations in global climate and hydrologic extremes including drought and flood, by impacting land memory processes. The role of the largest continental river basins as major locations for freshwater redistribution is highlighted. GRACE-based storage changes are in good agreement with those obtained from GLDAS simulations. Analysis of GLDAS-simulated TWSC illustrates several key characteristics of spatial and temporal land water storage variations. Global averages of TWSC were partitioned nearly equally between soil moisture and snow water equivalent, while zonal averages of TWSC revealed the importance of soil moisture storage at low latitudes and snow storage at high latitudes. Evapotranspiration plays a key role in dissipating globally averaged terrestrial water storage. Latitudinal averages showed how precipitation dominates TWSC variations in the tropics, evapotranspiration is most effective in the midlatitudes, and snowmelt runoff is a key dissipating flux at high latitudes. Results have implications for monitoring water storage response to climate variability and change, and for constraining land model hydrology simulations.},

  abstract = {Deep groundwater is an important source of drinking water, and can be preferable to shallower groundwaters where they are polluted by surface-borne contaminants. Surface-borne contaminants are disproportionately common in `modern' groundwaters that are made up of precipitation that fell since the {\textasciitilde}1950s. Some local-scale studies have suggested that groundwater pumping can draw modern groundwater downward and potentially pollute deep aquifers, but the prevalence of such pumping-induced downwelling at continental scale is not known. Here we analyse thousands of US groundwater tritium measurements to show that modern groundwater tends to reach deeper depths in heavily pumped aquifer systems. These findings imply that groundwater pumping can draw mobile surface-borne pollutants to deeper depths than they would reach in the absence of pumping. We conclude that intensive groundwater pumping can draw recently recharged groundwater deeper into aquifer systems, potentially endangering deep groundwater quality.},

  abstract = {Severe river floods often result in huge economic losses and fatalities. Since 1980, almost 1500 such events have been reported in Europe. This study investigates climate change impacts on European floods under 1.5, 2, and 3 K global warming. The impacts are assessed employing a multi-model ensemble containing three hydrologic models (HMs: mHM, Noah-MP, PCR-GLOBWB) forced by five CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs) under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 6.0, and 8.5). This multi-model ensemble is unprecedented with respect to the combination of its size (45 realisations) and its spatial resolution, which is 5 km over the entirety of Europe. Climate change impacts are quantified for high flows and flood events, represented by 10\% exceedance probability and annual maxima of daily streamflow, respectively. The multi-model ensemble points to the Mediterranean region as a hotspot of changes with significant decrements in high flows from -11\% at 1.5 K up to -30\% at 3 K global warming mainly resulting from reduced precipitation. Small changes ({$<$} {$\pm$}10\%) are observed for river basins in Central Europe and the British Isles under different levels of warming. Projected higher annual precipitation increases high flows in Scandinavia, but reduced snow melt equivalent decreases flood events in this region. Neglecting uncertainties originating from internal climate variability, downscaling technique, and hydrologic model parameters, the contribution by the GCMs to the overall uncertainties of the ensemble is in general higher than that by the HMs. The latter, however, have a substantial share in the Mediterranean and Scandinavia. Adaptation measures for limiting the impacts of global warming could be similar under 1.5 K and 2 K global warming, but have to account for significantly higher changes under 3 K global warming.},

This is concerning because drought events are common across the globe, with varying frequency, duration, and intensity, and are therefore unavoidable. Over the years, drought conditions have been at record levels in many regions, causing deep societal and economic impacts. However, little research has been conducted on connections between tourism/recreation and drought, revealing a distinct disconnect between the tourism/recreation sector and drought management. To bridge this gap in the current understanding of, and approaches to, managing drought in the tourism/recreation sector, we present an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that integrates tourism/recreation into the drought management process to ensure sustainable economic development and community vitality. The model presented here promotes understanding of critical interactions through a bottom-up stakeholder engagement process balanced with formal top-down management approaches.},

GRACE measurements are applied by calculating the magnitude of the deviation of regional, monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies from the time series' monthly climatology, where negative deviations represent storage deficits. Monthly deficits explicitly quantify the volume of water required to return to normal water storage conditions. We combine storage deficits with event duration to calculate drought severity. Drought databases are referenced to identify meteorological drought events in the Amazon and Zambezi River basins and the southeastern United States and Texas regions. This storage deficit method clearly identifies hydrological drought onset, end, and duration; quantifies instantaneous severity and peak drought magnitude; and compares well with the meteorological drought databases. It also reveals information about the hydrological effects of meteorological drought on regional water storage.},

River basins, concomitant with administrative zones, form a common unit for freshwater management. So far, no comprehensive, global analysis exists that would link the ecological challenges of the planet's river basins to the capacity of the societies to cope with them. We address this gap by performing a geospatial resilience analysis for a global set of 541 river basins. We use the social-ecological systems approach by relating three ecological vulnerability factors (human footprint, natural hazards, and water scarcity) with three adaptive capacity factors (governance, economy, and human development), based on temporal trajectories from 1990 to 2015. Additionally, we examine resilience by subtracting ecological vulnerability from adaptive capacity. The most striking result is the fundamentally different patterns of controlling factors of the resilience in different developing regions, particularly those of Africa and Asia. Their root causes are particularly low adaptive capacity in Africa and high ecological vulnerability in Asia. Alarmingly, the difference between those continents grew within the study period. Finally, this study highlights the rapid dynamics of adaptive capacity in comparison to ecological vulnerability, the latter having more inertia. Their fragile balance is of our interest; they can either support or counteract each other depending on the geographic location.},

  abstract = {Human actions and climate change have drastically altered river flows across the world, resulting in adverse effects on riverine ecosystems. Environmental flows (EFs) have emerged as a prominent tool for safeguarding the riverine ecosystems, but at the global scale, the assessment of EFs is associated with high uncertainty related to the hydrological data and EF methods employed. Here, we present a novel, in-depth global EF assessment using environmental flow envelopes (EFEs). Sub-basin-specific EFEs are determined for approximately 4400 sub-basins at a monthly time resolution, and their derivation considers the methodological uncertainties related to global-scale EF studies. In addition to a lower bound of discharge based on existing EF methods, we introduce an upper bound of discharge in the EFE. This upper bound enables areas to be identified where streamflow has substantially increased above natural levels. Further, instead of only showing whether EFs are violated over a time period, we quantify, for the first time, the frequency, severity, and trends of EFE violations during the recent historical period.  Discharge was derived from global hydrological model outputs from the ISIMIP 2b ensemble. We use pre-industrial (1801{\textendash}1860) quasi-natural discharge together with a suite of hydrological EF methods to estimate the EFEs. We then compare the EFEs with recent historical (1976{\textendash}2005) discharge to assess the violations of the EFE. These violations most commonly manifest as insufficient streamflow during the low-flow season, with fewer violations during the intermediate-flow season, and only a few violations during the high-flow season. The EFE violations are widespread and occur in half of the sub-basins of the world during more than 5 \% of the months between 1976 and 2005, which is double compared with the pre-industrial period. The trends in EFE violations have mainly been increasing, which will likely continue in the future with the projected hydroclimatic changes and increases in anthropogenic water use. Indications of increased upper extreme streamflow through EFE upper bound violations are relatively scarce and dispersed. Although local fine-tuning is necessary for practical applications, and further research on the coupling between quantitative discharge and riverine ecosystem responses at the global scale is required, the EFEs provide a quick and globally robust way of determining environmental flow allocations at the sub-basin scale to inform global research and policies on water resources management.},

Here we propose and illustrate a novel method of developing guidelines for calibration of system models. Our example is calibration of the phenology component of crop models. The approach is based on a multi-model study, where all teams are provided with the same data and asked to return simulations for the same conditions. All teams are asked to document in detail their calibration approach, including choices with respect to criteria for best parameters, choice of parameters to estimate and software. Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the various choices, we propose calibration recommendations that cover a comprehensive list of decisions and that are based on actual practices. HighlightsWe propose a new approach to deriving calibration recommendations for system modelsApproach is based on analyzing calibration in multi-model simulation exercisesResulting recommendations are holistic and anchored in actual practiceWe apply the approach to calibration of crop models used to simulate phenologyRecommendations concern: objective function, parameters to estimate, software used},

However, green water lacks explicit consideration in the existing planetary boundaries framework that demarcates a global safe operating space for humanity. In this Perspective, we propose a green water planetary boundary and estimate its current status. The green water planetary boundary can be represented by the percentage of ice-free land area on which root-zone soil moisture deviates from Holocene variability for any month of the year. Provisional estimates of departures from Holocene-like conditions, alongside evidence of widespread deterioration in Earth system functioning, indicate that the green water planetary boundary is already transgressed. Moving forward, research needs to address and account for the role of root-zone soil moisture for Earth system resilience in view of ecohydrological, hydroclimatic and sociohydrological interactions.},

  abstract = {Establishing a physically-based hydrological model for flood prediction in ungauged or data-limited catchments has always been a difficult problem. In this study, a data-driven approach based on the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data is proposed for flood prediction with the assistance of the Gamma Test. A runoff generation model together with a routing model based on the most advanced deep learning model, i.e. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is established. By calculating the noise of the input data, Gamma Test can effectively avoid the overfitting phenomenon with the LSTM network. Taking the a small-scale mountainous catchment from northern China as an example, Gamma Test in this study is used to help select the optimal combination of the GLDAS inputs for the runoff generation model, and meanwhile the input grids involved in the routing model. The established models are then verified based on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE), and it is found that the surface runoff generation model shows a good performance, with an average NSE value of 0.8708, while the baseflow-groundwater runoff generation model also results in an acceptable performance with an average NSE value of 0.6320. After the involvement of the observed rainfall data, the model performance (NSE) of the routing model has increased from 0.5738 to 0.7144. Finally, the runoff generation models and the routing model are integrated, and the grid-based GLDAS meteorological data are used directly to simulate the streamflow at the catchment outlet. The integrated model performs well with an NSE value of 0.7909, which indicates the feasibility of this data-driven approach for flood prediction using the gird-based meteorological data. The methodology adopted in this study provides a reference for flood prediction using data-driven models in ungauged or data-limited catchments.},

  abstract = {Drought is a naturally occurring event that is associated with virtually all climatic regions. Given its slow onset and other characteristics, including its spatial dimensions and duration, impacts are difficult to assess and have been, historically, poorly documented. These impacts are strongly influenced by a society's exposure to the hazard and the vulnerability of that society to the hazard. This vulnerability is continually changing in response to increasing population, land use changes, technology, government policies, and many other factors. Therefore, each drought event is superimposed on a society with differing vulnerabilities than existed when the previous drought event occurred. Drought impacts are increasing worldwide, both as a result of these changing vulnerabilities and, perhaps, because of an increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of drought events. To lessen societal vulnerability, it is imperative for nations to move away from the crisis management approach to drought management and toward a more proactive, risk-based approach, including the adoption of national drought policies that reflect this new paradigm. Emphasis must be given to the development of improved drought monitoring and early warning systems and the delivery of this information to decision makers at all levels. It is also essential that vulnerability assessments be conducted in order to determine who and what is at risk and why. A final step is the identification and implementation of appropriate mitigation measures or actions that will reduce future impacts on economic sectors and population groups.},

  abstract = {The Prairie Pothole Region of North America is characterized by millions of depressional wetlands, which provide critical habitats for globally significant populations of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife species. Due to their relatively small size and shallow depth, these wetlands are highly sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic changes, exhibiting inter- and intra-annual inundation dynamics. Moderate-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) alone cannot be used to effectively delineate these small depressional wetlands. By integrating fine spatial resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-temporal (2009{\textendash}2017) aerial images, we developed a fully automated approach to delineate wetland inundation extent at watershed scales using Google Earth Engine. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify aerial imagery with additional spectral indices to extract potential wetland inundation areas, which were further refined using LiDAR-derived landform depressions. The wetland delineation results were then compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and existing global-scale surface water products to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We tested the workflow on 26 watersheds with a total area of 16,576\,km2 in the Prairie Pothole Region. The results showed that the proposed method can not only delineate current wetland inundation status but also demonstrate wetland hydrological dynamics, such as wetland coalescence through fill-spill hydrological processes. Our automated algorithm provides a practical, reproducible, and scalable framework, which can be easily adapted to delineate wetland inundation dynamics at broad geographic scales.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the sensitivity of three key crops (alfalfa, barley and winter wheat) produced in the northwestern United States to climatic and agricultural market anomalies using widely used standardized indices. Rather than investigating sensitivity of crop yields (production per unit area), we focus on agricultural production (yield * harvested area) anomalies, which captures both variations in yield and the effect of decision-making factors such as allocation of cropping area. We used two well-known standardized precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) indices (SPI and EDDI, respectively) and a standardized crop value index in a multivariate linear regression analysis to determine the characteristic timing and time-scales of precipitation and ETo anomalies that best explain annual crop production anomalies. Since climatic and market factors are standardized, regression coefficients are interpreted as a sensitivity measure that captures the relative effect of climatic and agricultural markets on agricultural production. Results show that alfalfa production was most sensitive climatic anomalies while barley and wheat production was more responsive to crop prices. Sensitivity to precipitation anomalies followed gradients in precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture regimes across the study area where drier and warmer climates were associated with increased sensitivity to climatic anomalies. We found that irrigation decoupled alfalfa production from climatic variability, but the effect of irrigation on decoupling barley production was less clear. Winter wheat production was most sensitive to price anomalies, and alfalfa was least sensitive. Omitting agricultural market conditions and other farmer incentives may introduce biases in our understanding of how drought and climate change impact agricultural production.},

However, divergent post-processing dynamics of different GRACE solutions result in substantial uncertainties in GRACE TWSA and thus affecting predictive skills of FPI. To overcome this, this study develops an Integrated Flood Potential Index (IFPI) by linking the FPI derived from six GRACE products. The Gaussian copula is employed to establish the joint distribution of FPI from six spherical harmonic (SH) products and mass concentration blocks solutions. One of the most flood-prone regions, Yangtze River basin in China, is selected as a case study. We have identified and characterized the floods with different intensities using IFPI, which is evaluated against standardized discharge observations as well as the Total Storage Deficit Index (TSDI), Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI) and Combined Climatologic Deviation Index (CCDI). Results show that the area under curve (AUC) values of IFPI for different levels of floods are generally greater than FPIs and their ensemble mean, implying the better predictive skill for the large-scale flood events. During the three severest floods in 2010, 2015, and 2016, IFPI captures the flood variability exhibited by TSDI, WSDI, and CCDI, as well as hydrological observations. This proposed approach might provide reference for flood monitoring and from multi-mission satellite data.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major hydrologic flux in water resources planning and irrigation management. While recent advances in remote sensing (RS) have enabled availability of high spatial and temporal resolution ET data, a lack of information related to error in the estimations has made it challenging to use this data for on-farm irrigation management decision making. In this study, three commonly used single-source RS based ET models (pySEBAL {\textemdash} a new version of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land; SEBS {\textemdash} Surface Energy Balance System algorithm; and METRIC {\textemdash} Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) were used to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for almonds, processing tomatoes, and maize in the Central Valley of California. Model evaluation was conducted by comparing the predicted ETa from RS with in-situ measured ETa using surface renewal. Results indicated that the RS-based ETa estimations for all three models were within acceptable levels of uncertainty and agreed well with surface renewal estimates except for the underestimation by pySEBAL and METRIC during early season growth stages of processing tomatoes. This underestimation was attributed to the lack of accuracy when using single source ET models under lower vegetation cover condition (when ET is dominated by soil evaporation). Better estimates of ETa with pySEBAL and METRIC were detected at full cover, which explains the applicability of these two models to irrigation management during peak crop water demand. SEBS performed the best among the three RS-based models for daily ETa estimation for all crops. This suggests that SEBS-based ETa estimates can be adopted in operational irrigation management programs for farms that have not installed in field ETa sensors such as Tule Sensors (Tule Technologies Inc.). In addition, RS based ET is spatially distributed which can help to identity spatial variability between different irrigation zones.},

  abstract = {This study suggests a radical approach to hydrologic predictions in ungauged basins, addressing the long standing challenge of issuing predictions when in-situ river discharge does not exist. A simple but powerful rationale for measuring and modeling river discharge is proposed, using coupled advances in hydrologic modeling and satellite remote sensing. Our approach presents a Surrogate River discharge driven Model (SRM) that infers Surrogate River discharge (SR) from remotely sensed microwave signals with the ability to mimic river discharge in varying topographies and vegetation cover, which is then used to calibrate a hydrological model enabling physical realism in the resulting river discharge profile by adding an estimated mean of river discharge via the Budyko framework. The strength of SRM comes from the fact that it only uses remotely sensed data in prediction. The approach is demonstrated for 130 catchments in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia, a region of high economic and environmental importance. The newly proposed SR (SRL, representing L-band microwave) boosts the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of modeled flow, showing a mean NSE of 0.54, with 70\% of catchments exceeding NSE 0.4. We conclude that SRM effectively predicts high-flow and low-flow events related to flood and drought. Overall, this new approach will significantly improve catchment simulation capacity, enhancing water security and flood forecasting capability not only in the MDB but also worldwide.},

Compared with the open-loop CLSM simulation, assimilation estimates of groundwater variability exhibited enhanced skill with respect to measured groundwater in all four subbasins. Assimilation also significantly increased the correlation between simulated TWS and gauged river flow for all four subbasins and for the Mississippi River itself. In addition, model performance was evaluated for eight smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, all of which are smaller than the scale of GRACE observations. In seven of eight cases, GRACE assimilation led to increased correlation between TWS estimates and gauged river flow, indicating that data assimilation has considerable potential to downscale GRACE data for hydrological applications.},

The GRACE-DSI record spans from 2002 to 2014 and will be extended with the ongoing GRACE and scheduled GRACE Follow-On missions. The GRACE-DSI captures major global drought events during the past decade and shows overall favorable spatiotemporal agreement with other commonly used drought metrics, including the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The assets of the GRACE-DSI are 1) that it is based solely on satellite gravimetric observations and thus provides globally consistent drought monitoring, particularly where sparse ground observations (especially precipitation) constrain the use of traditional model-based monitoring methods; 2) that it has a large footprint ({\textasciitilde}350 km), so it is suitable for assessing regional- and global-scale drought; and 3) that it is sensitive to the overall terrestrial water storage component of the hydrologic cycle and therefore complements existing drought monitoring datasets by providing information about groundwater storage changes, which affect soil moisture recharge and drought recovery. In Australia, it is demonstrated that combining GRACE-DSI with other satellite environmental datasets improves the characterization of the 2000s ``Millennium Drought'' at shallow surface and subsurface soil layers. Contrasting vegetation greenness response to surface and underground water supply changes between western and eastern Australia is found, which might indicate that these regions have different relative plant rooting depths.},

  abstract = {Reliable prediction of groundwater depth fluctuations has been an important component in sustainable water resources management. In this study, a data-driven prediction model combining discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocess and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed for groundwater depth forecasting. Regular artificial neural networks (ANN), regular SVM, and wavelet preprocessed artificial neural networks (WANN) models were also developed for comparison. These methods were applied to the monthly groundwater depth records over a period of 37 years from ten wells in the Mengcheng County, China. Relative absolute error (RAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) were adopted for model evaluation. The results indicate that wavelet preprocess extremely improved the training and test performance of ANN and SVM models. The WSVM model provided the most precise and reliable groundwater depth prediction compared with ANN, SVM, and WSVM models. The criterion of RAE, r, RMSE, and NSE values for proposed WSVM model are 0.20, 0.97, 0.18 and 0.94, respectively. Comprehensive comparisons and discussion revealed that wavelet preprocess extremely improves the prediction precision and reliability for both SVM and ANN models. The prediction result of SVM model is superior to ANN model in generalization ability and precision. Nevertheless, the performance of WANN is superior to SVM model, which further validates the power of data preprocess in data-driven prediction models. Finally, the optimal model, WSVM, is discussed by comparing its subseries performances as well as model performance stability, revealing the efficiency and universality of WSVM model in data driven prediction field.},

  abstract = {Groundwater plays an important role in ecological systems. However, it is difficult to investigate the spatio\- temporal changes in groundwater storage (GWS) in the arid areas of Northwest China (NC) due to the limited observation data. Selecting the Tarim River Basin (TRB) in NC, this paper analyzed the variations in GWS and its relationships with climate factors based on downscaling the GRACE data (1 km {\texttimes} 1 km). We used random forest regression (RFR) to establish a model for GWS downscaling simulation by the grid data of GRACE-derived GWS, vegetation index and temperature. We also tested the validity of the downscaled results by comparing the errors between the downscaled GWS and the observed groundwater level by statistical indexes. The results showed that the GWS in the TRB mainly presented decreases from 2003 to 2016, with a significant decline in the southern Tianshan Mountains. The decreasing amplitude of GWS gradually weakened from north to south, and the fluctuations in the mountains were stronger than those in the central basin. The GWS changes presented seasonal differences, with strong decreases in summer and autumn but slight decreases in spring and winter. We also found that GWS in the TRB was more affected by temperature. The impact of precipitation on GWS changes was relatively weak, while temperature and evaporation had relatively significant influences on GWS changes. The negative effect of temperature on GWS in mountainous areas was still noticeable after a lag time of 1{\textendash}4 months. The development of agricultural land and groundwater exploitation affected GWS changes.},
